For a point to be differentiable and have a derivative, it must:
1. Be continuous at that point
2. $$f'(x^-)=f'(x)=f'(x^+)$$left limit's **slope** be the same as the right limit's **slope** which is same as the limit's **slope**. If there is a sharp jump from one slope to the other, then it is not differentiable
# Non Differentiable Cases
1. Cusp. Sharp change from left slope to right slope

2. Vertical Tangent. Sharp change from left/right limits slope to actual slope(which is undefined)

3. Discontinuity. Not continuous

4. Absolute function point. Sharp change from left limit slope to right limit slope. Consult [[Absolute Function]]
