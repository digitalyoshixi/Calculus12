A binary operator that does not change the first operator.
$a*e=a$
the value of $e$ is dependent on the operation performed.
This operation is polymorphic depending on the operation requested.

For example, if the operation is addition, then the equation would look like
$a+0=a$
$e$ is 0.

If the operation was multiplication, the equation would appear to be;
$a \times 1 = a$
