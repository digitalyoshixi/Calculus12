# $R^2$
2D lines can be written if:
- Given Slope
- Given Point
Or
- Given 2 Points
Written in [[Standard Form]] or [[Slope Intercept Form]]
### Vector Equation
$$\vec{r}=\vec{r_{0}}+t \vec{m}$$
or
$$[x,y]=[x_{0},y_{0}]+t[m_{1},m_{2}]$$
Where:
- $\vec{r}=[x,y]$ and is a position vector to any point on line
- $\vec{r_{0}}=[x_{0},y_{0}]$ and is the position vector to a **known** point
- $\vec{m}=[m_{1},m_{2}]$ and is the direction vector

### Slope Equation
$$m=\overrightarrow{[x_{2}-x_{1},y_{2}-y_{1}]}$$


# $R^3$
Pretty much the same as in $R^2$
The formula of a 3d line can be determined if:
- Given slope
- Given point
Or
- Given 2 Points
# Vector Equation
$$\vec{r}=\vec{r_{0}}+t \vec{m}$$
or
$$[x,y,z]=[x_{0},y_{0},z_{0}]+t[m_{1},m_{2},m_{3}]$$
Where:
- $r_{0}=[x_{0},y_{0},z_{0}]$ and is the position vector
- $\vec{m}=[m_{1},m_{2},m_{3}]$ and is the direction vector
- $t \epsilon \mathbb{R}$
