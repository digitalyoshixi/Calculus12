2D lines can be written if:
- Given Slope
- Given Point
Or
- Given 2 Points
Written in [[Standard Form]] or [[Slope Intercept Form]]
# Vector Equation
$$\vec{r}=\vec{r_{0}}+t \vec{m}$$
or
$$[x,y]=[x_{0},y_{0}]+t[m_{1},m_{2}]$$
Where:
- $\vec{r}=[x,y]$ and is a position vector to any point on line
- $\vec{r_{0}}=[x_{0},y_{0}]$ and is the position vector to a **known** point
- $\vec{m}=[m_{1},m_{2}]$ and is the direction vector

# Parametric Form
Making a formula for each vector component.
$$x=x_{0}+tm_{1}$$
$$y=y_{0}+tm_{2}$$
Vectors in parametric equations look like:

# Scalar Equation/Cartesian Equation
Turning your 2D line into [[Standard Form]] 
$$m=\frac{m_{1}}{m_{2}}$$
$$0=\frac{m_{1}}{m_{2}}x+x_{0}-y$$

# Symmetric Form
$$\frac{x-x_{0}}{m_{1}}=\frac{y-y_{0}}{m_{2}}$$
Does not apply to $R^3$
