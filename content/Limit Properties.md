Because limits have the unique ability to determine values at discontinuities, it is much more efficient to evaluate with limits than regular substitution.

##### Identity Rule
$$\lim_{x \to a} x = a$$
##### Constant Rule
if $a$ and $k$ for any constants then
$$\lim_{x \to a} k = k$$

##### Sums & Difference Rule
The limit of the sum, is the sum of the limits.
$$\lim_{x \to a}[f(x) \pm g(x)] = \lim_{x \to a}[f(x)] \pm \lim_{x \to a}[g(x)]$$
##### Scalar Product Rule
$$\lim_{x \to a} [cf(x)] = c[\lim_{ x \to a}f(x)]$$
##### Product Rule
$$\lim_{x \to a}[f(x)g(x)] = \lim_{x \to a}[f(x)] * \lim_{x \to a}[g(x)]$$
##### Quotient Rule
$$\lim_{x \to a}\left[\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\right] = \frac{\lim_{x \to a}[f(x)]}{\lim_{x \to a}[g(x)]}$$
##### Power Rule
Limit of the power is the power of the limit
$$\lim_{ x \to a}[f(x)^{n]} = [\lim_{ x \to a}f(x)]^{n} $$
