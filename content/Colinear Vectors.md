2 vectors are going in the same direction but have different scalars.
# Proving Collinearity
### Algebraic Proof
$$\vec{u}=k\vec{v}$$
if a value of $k$ exists, then $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$ are colinear
### Dot Product Proof
$$\vec{v}\cdot \vec{u}=|\vec{v}|*|\vec{u}|$$
As this would mean the angle is 0.
