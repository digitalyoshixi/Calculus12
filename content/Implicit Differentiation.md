# Procedure
If an equation defines y implicitly as a differentiable function of x, determine $\frac{dy}{dx}$ as follows:
1. Differentiate both sides of the equation in terms of x. 
	1. Use chain rule when differentiating y terms
2. Solve for $\frac{dy}{dx}$
# Example 1
Certain functions have both variables in a dependent relationship.
For example:
$$x^2+y^2=25$$
To find a general derivative, get the derivative of every term
$$2x + 2y = 0$$
Usually derivative is in terms of x. so apply this derivative for y to find x.
$$2x+2y\frac{dy}{dx}=0$$
$$2y\frac{dy}{dx}=-2x$$
$$\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{-2x}{2y}$$
$$\frac{dy}{dx}=-\frac{x}{y}$$
This will be the general derivative.
So to find at a given point, then you can just sub in x and y.
$$\frac{d}{dx}(3,2)$$
$=-\frac{-3}{2}$
$=1.5$

# Example 2
$$2xy-y^3=4$$
$$2x(y)-y^3=4$$
Now derive it
$2y+2x \frac{d}{dx}y - 3y^{2} \frac{d}{dx}=0$
$2x \frac{d}{dx}y - 3y^{2} \frac{d}{dx}=-2y$
