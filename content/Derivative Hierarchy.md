For [[Derivative|Chain Rule]]
There is an order to evaluating derivatives just like BEDMAS.
# Primary Derivative Rule
This will be the first thing you evaluate.
Example: $(2x+1)^6$
The first rule you will use is the [[Derivative|Power Rule]]
# Secondary Derivative Rule
Will be the 2nd thing you evaluate
Example: $(2x+1)^6$
The first rule you will use is the [[Derivative|Sum Rule]]
