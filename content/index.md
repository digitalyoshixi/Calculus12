Fucking horrid.
$$|x|$$
For a function like this, there is **NO** limit.
Because, it is a piecewise function
![[Pasted image 20240206133047.png]]
And so $\lim_{x \to a^-}$ will not be the same as $\lim_{x \to a^+}$
# To Piecewise

### Process
1. The conditions will be whatever makes the value inside the | | equal to zero. so, if b = 4, conditions will be around x being greater or equal to -4
2. Do temporary values i.e x<4, make x 3.999. think is it supposed to be negative or positive in the function
# Not [[Difference Quotient|Differentiable]] at 0
Cusp discontinuity.
$f(x)=|x|$
$f'(0^-)=-1$
$f'(0^+)=1$
-1 $\neq$ 1
# Absolute Function Product/Quotient Rule
$$|f(x)g(x)| = |f(x)|*|g(x)|$$
$$|\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}| = \frac{|f(x)|}{|g(x)|}$$
