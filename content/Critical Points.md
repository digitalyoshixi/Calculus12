# Critical Points
These are points that where $f'(x) = 0$ or $f'(x)$ is undefined.
From these, you can get global maximas/minimas
# Maxima/Minima
Maximas and minimas exist within a range, where there are limits for all defined values inside the range
### Global Maxima/Minima
![[Critical Points-20240328130304065.webp]]
- Must be restricted on an interval
- $0 \leq global min/max \leq \infty$. You can have infinite global mins/max
- Can be called  local & global max
### Local Maxima/Minima
![[Critical Points-20240328130803494.webp|703]]
A turning point that is NOT the global maxima/minima
# Fermat's Theorem(Stationary Points)
If $f(x)$ has a local/global maximum/minimum at $x=c$, then: 
- $f'(c)$ = 0
- OR $f'(c)$ does not exist
### Inverse Logic Does not apply
$f'(0)$ does not necessarily mean that there is a local minima or maxima.
# 2nd Derivative Test
For a critical point,
- if $f''(x) < 0$, the point is a local maximum
- if $f''(x) > 0$, the point is a local minimum
- if $f''(x) = 0$, a local maxima/minima does not exist
# Procedure for finding maxima/minima
1. Find the possible points. These are:
	- [[Critical Points]] within the interval
	- Endpoint values. (The points at the boundaries of the interval)
2. 2nd Derivative test for each found point
3. Largest point is maxima. Smallest is minima
