Pretty much the same as [[2D Vector Equation]]
The formula of a 3d line can be determined if:
- Given slope
- Given point
Or
- Given 2 Points
# Vector Equation
$$\vec{r}=\vec{r_{0}}+t \vec{m}$$
or
$$[x,y,z]=[x_{0},y_{0},z_{0}]+t[m_{1},m_{2},m_{3}]$$
Where:
- $r_{0}=[x_{0},y_{0},z_{0}]$ and is the position vector
- $\vec{m}=[m_{1},m_{2},m_{3}]$ and is the direction vector
- $t \epsilon \mathbb{R}$
