# Logarithm
**A logarithm is equal to an exponent**
![[Logarithms-20240308134342169.webp]]
Logarithms are the function that gets you the power from given a base and a result
![[Logarithms-20240308134356550.webp]]
**Base:** $0 < x < 1 ∪ x>1$
**Argument:** $0<x$
**Exponential:** $x∈ℝ$
### [[Log Properties]]
$$\log _b(1)=0$$
$$\log_{b}(b)=1$$
$$\log_{b}(b^x)=x$$
$$b^{\log_{b}x}=x$$
$$e^{\ln x}=x$$
$$log_{b}x = \frac{1}{\log_{x}b}$$

##### Logs ARGUMENT never be negative
Because, base^2 can NEVER be negative
A log is an exponent. remember
##### Log Bases never be negative
A log is an equation(sorta). Its saying that the argument^exponential can equal to the argument.
You provide it the base and argument, it returns the exponential.

The problem is when you give it a argument that the base can never equal.
eg: $\log_{-2}(8)$
$(-2)^x=8$
^ This will never be true. Unless you use [[Imaginary Numbers]]
##### Log Base can NEVER BE One
Because, 1^anything = 1. Which is saying you will have infinite y-values for one x value. You cant return anything

### [[Inverse Exponentials]]
If you graph out a logarithm function of any base, like $y=\log_{a}x$
then, it will look like a inverse [[Exponential Functions]] graph
##### Inverse of Growth
$y=\log_{a}x$
![[Logarithms-20240308134417906.webp]]
##### Inverse of Decay
$y=\log_{\frac{1}{a}}(x)$

### Natural Logarithms
ln is that function which can help you with logarithms of different bases.
it uses eulers number $e$ as the base. Golden ratio shenanigans

### Theorems
##### [[Change of Base Theorem]]
$\frac{\log t}{\log b} = \log_{b}t=x$
##### [[Power Law]]
$\log_{b}(x^n)=n\log_{b}x$
##### [[Product Law of Logarithms]]
$\log_{b}(mn)=\log_{b}m+\log_{b}n$
##### [[Quotient Law of Logarithms]]
$\log _b(\frac{m}{n})=\log_{b}(m)-\log_{b}(n)$
# [[Graphing Logarithms]]
### Famous 5(Depends on Base)

| x       | y   |
| ------- | --- |
| base^-2 | -2  |
| base^-1 | -1  |
| base^0  | 0   |
| base^1  | 1   |
| base^2  | 2   |
### [[Logarithm Transformation|Example With Transformation]]
Graph y = log(x-2)-5
1. Get the mapping rule (x+2,y-5)
2. Get the V.A. in this case it is x = 2
3. use [[Graphing Logarithms]] famous five

| x     | y   |
| ----- | --- |
| 10^-2 | -2  |
| 10^-1 | -1  |
| 10^0  | 0   |
| 10^1  | 1   |
| 10^2  | 2   |
with mapping rule (x+2,y-5)

| x+2     | y-5   |
| ----- | --- |
| 2.01 | -7  |
| 2.1 | -6  |
| 3  | -5   |
| 12  | -4   |
| 102  | -3   |
**You can use decimals. Dont do shit like 10^-2+2, make them decimal**
4. Y intercept? X intercept? 
5. Domain? Range?(usually Y∈ℝ)
