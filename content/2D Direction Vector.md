A vector that denotes the 'slope' of a vector.
It is usually added to a [[2D Position Vector]] to show that it continues.
If 2 [[Vector Equation]] have the same direction vector, then they are parallel
# Perpendicular Direction Vector
To find the perpendicular direction vector:
1. Flip the x and y components 
2. Make x component negative 
$$\vec{r}=[3,2]$$
$$\perp\vec{r}=[-2,3]$$
Confirm with [[Dot Product]]
The components $x$ and $y$ of this perpendicular vector corresponds to the coefficients $a$ and $b$ in [[Standard Form]] of your regular vector.
