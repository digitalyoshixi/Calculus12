# Increasing and Decreasing Intervals
### Increasing
function is increasing on an interval if 
$f(x_{1})<f(x_{2})$ 
![[Curve Sketching-20240404133824529.webp|213]]
Derivative must be positive
$$f'(x) > 0$$
### Decreasing
function is decreasing on an interval if 
$f(x_{1})>f(x_{2})$ 
![[Curve Sketching-20240404133905134.webp|210]]
Derivative must be negative
$$f'(x) < 0$$
### Chart Method
1. Find critical values
2. Make a table of intervals between each critical value
3. Sub in values into the **f'(x)** function for each interval and see if positive or negative
