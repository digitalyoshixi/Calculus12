# Continuous 
For the function to be continuous at a point, 2 conditions:
1. Limit must exist
2. $$\lim_{ x \to a }f(x) = f(a)$$
This will always be try for continuous functions

# Discontinuous
For the function to be discontinuous at a point, 2 conditions:
$$\\lim_{ x \to a }f(x) \neq f(a)$$
OR 
$$\lim_{ x \to a }f(x) \ \ \ \ DNE $$
OR 
$L = \pm\infty \ \ OR \ \ f(x) = \pm\infty$
True for all discontinuous functions
