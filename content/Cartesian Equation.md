# Cartesian Equations
In $R^2$, cartesian equations are for lines
In $R^3$, cartesian equations are for planes
# $R^2$
In $R^2$, Cartesian equation for a line is in [[Standard Form]]
$$ax+by+c=0$$
$$m=\frac{m_{1}}{m_{2}}$$
$$0=\frac{m_{1}}{m_{2}}x+x_{0}-y$$

### Normal Vector and Cartesian Equation Relationship
For a normal vector $n=\overrightarrow{[a,b]}$
The Cartesian equation will use a and b from the normal vector.
$$ax+by+c=0$$
So for example, $n=\overrightarrow{[2,1]}$
the cartesian equation will follow: $2x+y+c=0$
