A vector is a quantity that describes both magnitude and direction.

# Vector Types
### Unit Vector
Magnitude of vector is 1
# Vector Relationships
### Equal Vectors
2 vectors are equal if they have the same magnitude and direction
$\vec{u} = \vec{v}$
### Opposite Vectors
Same magnitude, different direction
$\vec{u}=-\vec{v}$
### Collinear Vectors
2 vectors are going in the same direction but have different scalars.
$\vec{u}=k\vec{v}$
# Vector Addition
2 Methods. Same logic
### Parallelogram Law

### When $|\vec{u}| + |\vec{v}| = |\vec{u}+\vec{v} |$
Only happens in 2 cases:
1. Either $\vec{v}$ or $\vec{u}$ are 0
2. If $\vec{u}$ = $k \vec{v}$. $| \vec{u}+\vec{v}| \leq |\vec{u}| + |\vec{v}|$. $k \epsilon N$

# Vector Scalar Multiplication
![[Vectors-20240508124905073.webp]]
For a vector $k\vec{v}$ the scalar value is $k|\vec{v}|$
Direction does not change unless the k value is negative, in which case it flips to the other direction
