# Vector Types
### Unit Vector
Magnitude of vector is 1
# Vector Relationships
### Equal Vectors
2 vectors are equal if they have the same magnitude and direction
$\vec{u} = \vec{v}$
### Opposite Vectors
Same magnitude, different direction
$\vec{u}=-\vec{v}$
### Collinear Vectors
2 vectors are going in the same direction but have different scalars.
$\vec{u}=k\vec{v}$
