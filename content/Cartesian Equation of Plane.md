You must first be able to get the [[Perpendicular Slopes|Normal Line]] to the plane.
To do this normal vector, get the cross product of the 2 direction vectors of the plane.
Once you get the normal line $\vec{n}=[a,b,c]$
The formula for the cartesian plane is
$ax+bx+cz+d=0$
where $a,b,c$ can be gotten from the normal line.
To get $d$, sub in the position vector's components as the $x,y,z$ values into the cartesian equation.
