# Rationalizing The Denominator
$\frac{1}{\sqrt2}$ = $\frac{1}{\sqrt2} * \frac{\sqrt2}{\sqrt2}$  = $\frac{\sqrt2}{2}$
### Why it is important
If you don't, it messes up the limits. 
Example:
$\frac{x-4}{\sqrt x-2}$
when x = 4, it will be $\frac{0}{0}$
This doesn't really tell us anything.
There is a hole at x=4
$\frac{(x-4)(\sqrt x + 2)}{x - 4}$ = $\frac{\sqrt x + 2}{1}$
# Law of rationalization
$\frac{a}{\sqrt a}$ = $\sqrt{a}$
