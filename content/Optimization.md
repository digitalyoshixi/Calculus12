# Optimizing In Economics
### Extreme Problems In Economics
- $C(x) \to$ Cost function
	- $C'(x) \to$ Marginal Cost
- $p(x) \to$ Demand/Price Function
- $R(x) \to$ Revenue Function
	- $R(x) = xp(x)$
	- $R'(x) \to$ Marginal Revenue Function
- $P(x) \to$ Profit Function
	- $P'(x) \to$ Marginal Profit
- $c(x) \to$ average cost
	- $c(x) = \frac{C(x)}{x}$
Average cost is a minimum when marginal cost = average cost *\* when the average rate of change = instantaneous rate of change*
