In $R^3$, a plane $\vec{r}$ is determined by a vector $\vec{r}=[x_{0},y_{0},z_{0}]$ and 2 non-collinear vectors $\vec{a}=[a_{1},a_{2},a_{3}]$ and $\vec{b}=[b_{1},b_{2},b_{3}]$
$$\vec{r}=\vec{r_{0}}+s \vec{a} + t \vec{b}$$
You need 2 direction vectors for a plane

In terms of vectors created by points A,B,C,
$\vec{r}=A+s(\overrightarrow{AB})+t(\overrightarrow{AC})$
