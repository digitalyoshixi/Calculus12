Every other vector can be created as a combination of the 2 non-collinear vectors.

# 2D Spanning Set
If a pair of 2D vectors is:
- Non-zero components
- Non-collinear
Then they span $R^2$. They will be considered co-planar and span the same plane in $R^3$
# 3D Spanning Set
You need atleast 3 3D vectors to span $R^3$
- Non-zero components
- Non-collinear
- Non-coplanar
You cannot have 2 vectors that span $R^3$ as those would always be considered cplanar
