2+ vectors that span the same plane in $R^3$
These vectors will share the same $R^2$ space
# Proving Coplanarity
If you have 2 vectors $\vec{a},\vec{b}$, they are ALWAYS coplanar.
If you have 3 vectors $\vec{a},\vec{b},\vec{c}$, you must prove that they are all coplanar to eachother
### Cross Product Method
If $\vec{a} \times \vec{b}$ is colinear with $\vec{b} \times \vec{c}$  then $\vec{a},\vec{b},\vec{c}$ are coplanar
### Algebraic Method
You can write one vector as a linear combination of the other 2.
$\vec{a},\vec{b}\ \epsilon\ \vec{c}$
$\vec{c} = s\vec{a} + t\vec{b}$
